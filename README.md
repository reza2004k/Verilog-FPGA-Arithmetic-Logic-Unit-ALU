# Verilog-FPGA-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU
A fundamental Digital Logic Design project implemented in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). This module simulates and performs basic arithmetic and logical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, etc.), with outputs visualized on a seven-segment display and status indicators shown on LEDs on an FPGA board.
